# Big Data Exercise - Chapter 17

This repository has all the files needed for the Big Data assignment from Chapter 17 of the textbook. The Python scripts work with a SQLite database to do tasks like reading, adding, updating, and deleting records. The files included are exercise_17_2.py, exercise_17_1.py, books.db, and books.sql. You need Python 3 and the pandas library to run the scripts. These files can help you practice SQL queries and learn how to use Python with databases.
