# Big Data Exercise - Chapter 17

This repository contains everything needed for the Big Data exercise from Chapter 17 of the textbook. The Python script works with a SQLite database to perform basic operations like reading, adding, updating, and deleting records. The files included are `exercise_17_2.py`, `books.db`, and `books.sql`. To run the exercise, you need Python 3 and the `pandas` library installed. Use the script to practice SQL queries and learn how to interact with databases.
